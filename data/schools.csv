Although the school administration had stated that teachers were to continue teaching and remain neutral during the protest, one teacher told all of their students to leave their classroom and locked the door, so everyone would have to attend the protest. , During a staff development session, teachers were assigned a handout describing an actual conflict that had occurred between students at the school to be able to collaborate on how to handle this situation. The teacher-speaker shared a presentation and handout describing that the school had just had a “Culture Night” in which students were invited to represent their cultures’ food, clothing, etc. The teacher-speaker described how a Palestinian student group had a table at the event and been using “their right to free speech” to protest against Israel while handing out anti-Israel boycott (BDS) pamphlets. They explained that an Israeli student visiting the Culture Night took offense to the Palestinian students chants causing a scuffle. This was supposed to be a night of sharing cultural foods/customs/traditions, not protesting.

Perhaps organized by an outside group (Palestine Youth Movement). Jewish students reported feeling unsafe and targeted., Misleading article including false and one-sided statements was published online in the Redhawk Talk student newsletter. The article was titled “Palestine-Israel: Who, When, How, and Why?” A Sammamish faculty advisor took the article down without explanation., Coordinated walkouts at Newport, Bellevue, and Sammamish high schools. At Sammamish High School, flyers featuring Samidoun and Super UW logos were posted around the school, promoting the walkout and containing anti-Israel and antisemitic blood libels and propaganda, including advocating for the elimination of the State of Israel. An outdoor display on school property featured a Palestinian flag with signs and glorifying the “martyrs.” The display was featured as a “story” on the Sammamish High School ASB Instagram page. Questions to the district about whether Jewish students at Sammamish High School could make a similarly-sized on-campus vigil with a large Israeli flag, posters and messages for the hostages and victims of the 10/7 terrorist attack were unanswered.","2023Dec14-SammamishHS.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725480000000/AJ0cARgcQRi95vbGWwe3Kw/izdHymGsVlvCYxdO0Qs2s2UgN8HO7_lgfTCGlAY2Fbt9EwEcuDqN7ALR6VToU361R4liFjne5zxAbbscbWmRmkqfaFZr95Qk7GbiIt0OdhwdmNpa3FTMUZw84HM9NA7qcDQ-KivkHPDS_IkTlvwACsA_pdvOvVzYBQrAH0cdb8c/DbLtgzbaYv8ONON7JQPu-qFnTFnz3lVcOzBIpvraDpQ),2024Dec14-SammamishHS-SchoolLetter.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725480000000/hicbKKRf8z3R5Jl3Y5Y0Ag/UvnKupo6vYqhgjSVo8bh2z7GS6iLPDpeAFUM-yzn179CiI2Z9TYWChbvY2GAiVi_3XTDNnrXu5JrwRzDVFQ8SnbHTYBzjVVu-Ezb3Nq4NZjhGGlEN6H3yf5jMkx9dW6mXypq1PbT0US-53rdH24VhoNeS_FWhV2wjg8IOjK05ZjneeC7LGnQ6QH15_ebxWRM/c9wrsV46fXjTkCNJ8soj5p-dPZ09nBu99QAY4SuIX7Y),2024Jan31-SammamishHS-RedhawkArticle.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725480000000/NXXAe3k8h19YWigtTixs4Q/MEIgyLQ4QAeiLOpy-mxmo7acHUz4QAKA-juqB_Z8-X2YG9OM4tbaWQ5C-DmrMRgay4NpISUZu3zfi1B0QJSA15gOsBfs6yNOniNXcLZ3jzJ9zMzdaRCEsgNNSOJ2bY-GZQHmRBkTeivsZkJ31PIQVH8xiY-EGVbjr0vh7OKfxZ_uE3wY98HroymNvk52yc_b/hn8Dngav4j0fX_lSwN-xjvOTmKY1gsAKQ7-60oX_cl0),2024Jan31-SammamishHS-SchoolLetter.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725480000000/yhGNP_Rb0F8IxXFfO9fnAw/Uj2hae7dl0hWq6L7EQnxur9KPLOMYZSCEUO1n3ynuwWHToqr5eekuYRH37HJYesB84r-akq_FVOOKiJ3sjcSVNGgBbniRYlZ6IqrJn5DlHNUCNWjJcdRcXBxd8zxDwvdRICx23_Rs9gBpflWKX94UDKTCg-t25BxJ_4iGF9kiRAuFajnTCIzMZZ4AmTom5Zd/dwp1Y_yKjZqyhBIUGfQ48kvX_Ztg3pL1TcCZDSLOYnQ),2024Apr-SammamishHS-ASB-Instragram-Story.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725480000000/OIdxOMQqHaMn0-4hQeX6bQ/lUtotMhCVbgGfc3Ur76UH63C4TOTxp3CpwpqAdZ4HK5w_MnfG20TXv6isUSZKGpJFhOK6G73MPRRISdn4jYPFTxljNGI2JM3wQkS_B-SjJm8yV0K03sLpS8oS5RFt95X2en3s3Rdjx0WBuG6-b32F3HCQ8a1GFYxfqHvYPXOPhx5t5oymGfaYqZt4Aglun_FG9jt1hvh_gDG2NkowzObNg/TmRHFpetA6c26mcnLorS6WXq9Pl_uhdT_TASdr9E264)","Kurt Cohrs, Sammamish High School Assistant Principal, has shared multiple false and misleading social media posts (IG: kgcohrs, now a private account) regarding Israel including posts insinuating that Jews and Israel represent ""white supremacy"" and are committing ""genocide.""",,,,,,"100 140th Ave. SE Bellevue, WA 98005",47.6077315,-122.153633,https://www.stophateinschools.org/school-details?recordId=,recQVJxwoRNiplYwF,https://www.stophateinschools.org/school-details?recordId=recQVJxwoRNiplYwF,6/5/2024 9:07am,Josh Herst,,
