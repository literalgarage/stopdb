School administration did not intervene. One of the participating students is reported to have a history of antisemitic bullying, harassment, and intimidation, both in-person and online, targeting Jewish and Israeli females at Newport.

Questions to the district about whether Jewish students at Sammamish High School could make a similarly-sized on-campus vigil with a large Israeli flag, posters and messages for the hostages and victims of the 10/7 terrorist attack were unanswered.","2023Dec14-SammamishHS.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1723860000000/ZXChKFt9xIEfeenF-WLrTQ/pjpyOixM31wqF-BuGq_HP3a7B35kLUNzCAO3javRl_3_1jKTYSDf7BrG-8TtIQ-u1TOL0P2Up_7qCUmuhlGY0t_xxSTYL2oOWRUAIC2euiP9w5ovJp3kryU50F8Qa1Sbr6UVvP_-JvYgvDFV_yhh5RNvfCbvMigqhz7yflw7NUI/AnBw-vnnQYYZLXLqnU6fb3F7HS-Z2RyB5MBBsk102ng),2024Dec14-SammamishHS-SchoolLetter.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1723860000000/DP9-BJVRfaZTSvM-5arH7g/636VDzajrQmraDvsjIXjuHn68C89wquwYjagaruR4BwU5skXqoUvRiGh7RH28z2TBCHjxz9tZrBJmbaOsdY1-5kJ8RU3Nbi9utGUYgALv3hZkohfN2A6QeqOAun5IOaBV3QatILLxv5xHtRJO8Z7Yb0caEYT2dgRZWQBT1XvIXFIHtlkUUMXJrJ8KqPTsg4S/75va6W3A3LLFwE3RQ_Gff12wuUEu7gPi9GPFeBFlxis),2024Jan31-SammamishHS-RedhawkArticle.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1723860000000/bRpysYOK28JDPjPVupmCZA/iTl--kog1wLMM60APylTBWlhxBlZ64MCmk7cjjegXxBKVY1U9zsAid2l5y_B8Yn8HgLNWs8BvREuIAHVozC_He6HXzStbKSZ2-wsbRxhLnTksge-y25p9ZU0uAL78ue0qWlkpFYxfRoIwf3WrXLS2VKeiH3sNpUKvH62BCiqQGmzo8QhOq0hQrnAtg_xfNBK/CiQZiJuJgdTxq6hcrNExspnbsCteHluF8Op79nSSe3w),2024Jan31-SammamishHS-SchoolLetter.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1723860000000/iUh6qJlWVB2z1ahVac42Cg/mIzOWaptmgxgy30d9hZY1nZX43saWK8jzSG93JfrOIjyXEhU9g6VcbgaFT-GqObyrdFuEXYk9YOY3Xi1gLKtXyroFUVoyDMSgDrZ_YKgr50jBJQWuBq_E6q07vTp3TkfXZXY5AV8nhY38LiZoza80fKtsdsP1C_hgr-TWPBh40g3wgjk8UuAnFFTXagNGFiU/IZtrC_LTGmmeAuggxGJgED93ZxApJsnOZM_t0EicUX8),2024Apr-SammamishHS-ASB-Instragram-Story.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1723860000000/5JhrkMGX4je-rm_bpwbkpQ/BCKMaV9t5XP2EHmTycAhHn1dMsyDvB2Tqf5M8E_Ayr8R7lTG0fDmTRsUnaGTedE56wZDy1dq8EhxR0yE_ikthuwKVkI6qLMIFPZ-SKaFTKMP-148Fxsj963zjJztwihev8gDbVJGEWhoCPZQAc_F48jtG_9xYDfPzgRrGxFaUsMdQZmPgLFdmqws3jEMlTROusUICYT7oeUhATDaVXKmxA/-_-uVLu1SylW_WUi25eKm8z4ASlWW53kPaMsIdoeByE)","Kurt Cohrs, Sammamish High School Assistant Principal, has shared multiple false and misleading social media posts (IG: kgcohrs, now a private account) regarding Israel including posts insinuating that Jews and Israel represent ""white supremacy"" and are committing ""genocide.""",,,,,,"100 140th Ave. SE Bellevue, WA 98005",47.6077315,-122.153633,https://www.stophateinschools.org/school-details?recordId=,recQVJxwoRNiplYwF,https://www.stophateinschools.org/school-details?recordId=recQVJxwoRNiplYwF,6/5/2024 9:07am,Josh Herst,,
