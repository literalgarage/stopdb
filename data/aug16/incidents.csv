This is almost entirely student driven and organized and does not have direct input for admin. The incident report on your site from last year's event states that the principal prohibited the JSU from participating in the showcase and that the information came from a news source. What occurred inside JSU at the time is that the student organizers of the showcase reached out to the JSU leadership and leadership at the time failed to follow through on participating and communicating in the showcase. They did however put up Jewish cultural informative posters around the school. Then the article was published misrepresenting the entire situation and driving an unnecessary wedge between groups of Lincoln students.
